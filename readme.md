# Very Vanilla Doom
This is a little project that lets you compile and run the original Doom source code with only minor cleanup for retrocompatibility. (Only tested on Ubuntu 19)

The program DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY GAME FILES. You need to buy the .wad file from any platform like Steam or GOG etc.

## Compiling

The original X11 code is still in use, and you need 32 bit architecture compatibility. These are the requirements:

```
sudo apt install libx11-dev:i386 libxext-dev:i386
sudo apt install gcc:i386
```

Create a "linux/" directory in linuxdoom-1.10/, then just run Make inside "linuxdoom-1.10/"

## Running
Doom only runs on 8-bit displays, so I suggest you to make a floating x11 display using Xephyr:

```
sudo apt install xserver-xephyr
Xephyr :3 -screen 960x600x8 -ac &
```

Name the wad file "doomu.wad" and put it inside the "linuxdoom-1.10/" folder.
Run:
``` 
DISPLAY=:3 ./linux/linuxxdoom
```
to run the game inside the previously created display.

## Sound
The soundserver now works, but still uses /dev/dsp to output sounds.
To fix this you can use "padsp", a wrapper that redirects the program's access from /dev/dsp to a PulseAudio sound server.
You need the 32 bit version of padsp: sudo apt install padsp:i386
To enable it just run 
``` 
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pulseaudio/libpulsedsp.so
``` 
before starting the game. 
Compile the soundserver: 

```
cd sndserv
make
```

Put the compiled "sndserver" file in the same folder of the "linuxxdoom" executable.
Run the game and enjoy some low quality gunshots.

Background music doesn't work, as the original code for music playback is or seems to be incomplete.
